# MyPetPlaces

## Welcome to our Module 2 project for Ironhack! This is a CRUD application designed for pet owners who want to bring their cute little love bundles everywhere :dog: :dog2: :cat:

## MyPetPlaces is designed... well, to find pet friendly places. It works based on your location and brings up the best options of hotels, restaurants and parks/plazas/malls/etc where you can take your pets.

# How does it work?

## You need log in to use MyPetPlaces. Once you're logged, you can browse different places, reviews of those places and also add/edit/delete your own reviews. You can also suggest new places to be added to the platform.

# How did you make it?

## We used:
- Express :construction: as foundation
- JavaScript :green_book: for code
- Handlebars :memo: for views
- Bulma :art: for components
- Mongoose :game_die: for models and database communication

# And who are you? :grey_question:

## Cintia Thieme and DÃ©bora Nisenbaum, nice to meet you!
